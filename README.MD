In order for the code in this SURF branch to work it is necessary to install opencv with the opencv_contrib package
The easiest way to do this is to create a new virtual environment on your pc by using the following tutorial:

Next in order to run a file it might be necessary to install some packages that were included (see top of that particular code), such as Numpy etc.
just google the name of the package and how to install.

It is also necessary to download a set of video images at

For example the development test set can be found in the folder cyberzoo_poles/20190121-135009
Place the these images in the same locations as were you created the git repository, but add the folder to a .gitnore file in order not to upload them to the git when you push
